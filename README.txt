A library that facilitates working with praat and praat files.

Praat is a software program for doing phonetic analysis and annotation 
of speech.  Praat can be found at http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/

Very much a work in progress.  This will house various resources that I 
use in working with praat.
