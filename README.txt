# praatIO


A library that facilitates working with praat and praat files.

Praat is a software program for doing phonetic analysis and annotation 
of speech.  [Praat can be downloaded here](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/)

Very much a work in progress.  This will house various resources that I 
use in working with praat.


## Usage

'import praatio'

See /test for example usages


## Installation


Navigate to the directory this is located in and type:

	python setup.py install

If python is not in your path, you'll need to enter the full path e.g.

	C:\Python27\python.exe setup.py install
